## Common Workflows

### Monthly Invoice Run
When asked to "run monthly invoices" or "bill clients":

2. For each customer, create invoice with standard line items
3. Send all invoices: `~/skills/qb-cli/run.sh invoice send <id>`

### Record Payment
When a payment comes in:
1. Find the customer: `~/skills/qb-cli/run.sh customer query "SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE DisplayName = '...'"`
2. Find open invoices: `~/skills/qb-cli/run.sh invoice query "SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE CustomerRef = '...' AND Balance > '0'"`
3. Apply payment (Phase 2): `~/skills/qb-cli/run.sh payment create --customer-id X --amount Y --invoice-id Z`
